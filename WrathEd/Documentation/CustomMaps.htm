To use assets added with your mod you need to edit the configuration file for Worldbuilder to load your mod. After the mod is created, there is nothing else to do, simply launch your mod and play on your new map.<br />
<br />
<span class="title">Configuring Worldbuilder</span><br />
To launch Worldbuilder with a mod you have to edit the [CNC3/RA3/CNC4]_wb_1.0.cfg, located commonly in the root of your C&C3/KW directory or the Data folder of your RA3/C&C4 directory. You will need to add a line similar to the following to the top of the file:
<pre>try-add-config C:\Users\[Username]\My Documents\[Game]\mods\SampleMod\SampleMod_1.0.SkuDef</pre>
This will tell Worldbuilder to attempt to load your mod, and allows you to create maps using the new assets added in your mod.<br />
<br />
<span class="title">Custom Maps and Overrides</span><br />
If you have created a map that uses an override (for example a mission map) you will need to build this map. <span class="important">For Kane's Wrath you also need to have the MapMetaData element copied into a new file and edit the FileName attribute.</span> Please refer to the SampleMission how it should look like.<br />
Building a map works just like building a mod. Just use BuildMap instead of BuildMod and leave out the version.
