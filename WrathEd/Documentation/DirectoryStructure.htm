If you are creating a Mod <span class="important">for Tiberium Wars, Red Alert 3, or Tiberium Twilight the name can be no more than 15 characters long</span>.<br />
<br />
The directory structure for your mod should look similar to the image below:

<br />
<span class="title">Required Files:</span><br />
If you are building a Mod for Tiberium Wars, Red Alert 3, or Tiberium Twilight you have to have a file called mod.xml in your Data folder.<br />
<span class="important">For Kane's Wrath</span> your main file would be called <span class="important">static.xml</span>. This is also the file that is referenced by the default batch files supplied with WrathEd. These names are hard coded and renaming will cause your Mod not to work.<br />
<br />
<span class="title">String Table:</span><br />
Tiberium Wars, Red Alert 3, and Tiberium Twilight support a file called mod.str to store strings. This is a simple text file and only needed if you add or modify text in the game.<br />
An example of an entry in the mod.str file:
<pre>NAME:Orca
"Orca Fighter"
END</pre>
<span class="important">Kane's Wrath does not support a mod.str file.</span> Therefor you have to extract and edit the <span class="important">cnc3.csf</span> located in:
<pre>Kane's Wrath\Lang-[language]\1.2\patch2.big</pre>
There are several csf editors available but it is recommended to check if it isn't outdated.
